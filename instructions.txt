Credits:
    - Tests were created and testsed by Almog Tabo and Nadav Tur
    - We would like to thank https://github.com/amitaifrey/os1-tests for some of the 2020 tests.
    - Also, we would like to thank the (only) two people who filled out the google form and submitted tests:
        Eran (7 tests), GiladF (1 test)


Instructions:
    1. Extract the given zip using unzip or manually to the folder where your smash binary is located at.
    2. From that same folder, run ./tests/runner/runner.sh
    3. The script should take about 1-2 minute to run, and after you would get an indicative output.


Additional Info:
    - If you haven't implemented the timeout command, just remove the test inputs with "timeout" in their names.
    - If you would like to run a single test, you may run ./tests/runner/runner.sh <test_name>
    - If you run the "./tests/runner/runner.sh" command inside VSCode, it will open a diff window for every test you failed.
    - You may see the error "runner: Timeout, killing child" in your .err file - 
        it means we detected your code got stuck, and had to terminate it.
    - Input files contain ^Z, ^C and ^(digit) lines. These are all instructions for our runner to send to your program.
        ^Z and ^C will send CTRL+Z/CTRL+C accordingly, and ^(digit) will sleep for <digit> seconds before sending the next command.
    - Your smash output is being redirected to <test>.out and <test>.err, 
        then further proceesed by our python script that removes pids, jobs runtime and timezone.
        Pids are replaced by relative pids, which means that they get a unique id according to the order they appeared on the output.
        After the processing, the original files are removed, and only the .proceesed files remain.
        To keep them, you may set the env variable KEEP_ORIG to 1. 
        In that case your command would be "KEEP_ORIG=1 ./tests/runner/runner.sh".
    - If you're missing a .expected file in the output directory, it means your output was too big. 
        See point above to see how to keep the original file.
    - There is a low chance that the python script that removes pids will replace a command output with a 
        relative pid as described above. If that happends, try to run ./tests/runner/runner.sh <test_name> again.
    - The runner.sh script runs a number of tests at the same time. 
        To change that amount, you may set the env variable TASKS.
        for example, you may run "TASKS=2 ./tests/runner/runner.sh" to run only two tests at the same time.

Thats it, good luck!
